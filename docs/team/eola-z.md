### Project: NetworkBook

NetworkBook is a desktop address book application 
that School of Computing students can use to track and
network with peers. The user interacts with it using
a CLI, and has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written
in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Here are my contributions to the project.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for the features `remove duplicates`,
        `course` and `specialisation`
        * Added an `About` section and documented new features per version.
    * Developer Guide
        * Added documentation for the `Logic` component of the DG   

Here are some extracts from my contributions to the 
user guide:

* Description of `specialisation`:
  * > You can add a specialisation to an existing contact.  
  A new specialisation will be added to the contact's list 
  of specialisations, and no new contact will be created.
  Specialisations are displayed in the order they are added.
* Format:
  * `add /spec [specialisation] /index [index]`
* UI mockups:
  * Created the UI mockups in the user guide to emulate
  the application's behavior.
