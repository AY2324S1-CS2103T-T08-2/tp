- This is **NetworkBook, developed for the team project component of CS2103T AY2324-S1**.
- The project is based on the [_AddressBook-Level3_](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3) software project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org), which is a desktop application used for managing contact details.
  - It is **written using OOP**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  - It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

## Project direction

1. **Product name:** NetworkBook
2. **Target user profile:** Computing Professionals from NUS / studying in NUS who are looking to network with each other
3. **Value proposition:** As computing students and professionals network with alumni to expand their career prospects, our app keeps a list of contacts of people that each user networks with.

- Users can sort contacts by priority, courses taken/taking, specialisation(s) taken/intending to take.
- This project is offline, and has a static online page that contains user manual and download link.
